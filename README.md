# Project Summary

In this project we'll use a package called `bcrypt` to authenticate users. Bcrypt is a package based off the popular bcrypt hashing algorithm. It exposes several functions that we can use to salt, hash, and compare our passwords without exposing the users plain-text password.

## Setup

* `Fork` and `clone` this repository.
* `cd` into the project directory.
* Run `npm install`.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, setup a basic Express server

### Instructions

* Navigate to `server/index.js`
    * Begin by setting up a basic express server
    * This should include the following:
        * Express
        * Express-Session
        * Dotenv
        * BodyParser (or Express' json parser);
        * Massive
        * a test `get` endpoint that returns a `200` status
        * The `listen` method
    * Once your server is setup, test it with `postman` or your browser.

### Solution


## Black Diamond

* Add a profile page that we're redirected to on login that uses the information from our logged in user.
